    <h1>Columbo: Word Detective</h1>
    <p>
      Columbo allows you to search for several terms on almost any webpage. 
      It highlights each term a different color and allows you to quickly navigate to each word. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Try it out by clicking the Columbo button at the top of the page. To install it, simply drag the button to your browser's bookmarks toolbar.
      To use it, just click the bookmark on any webpage to load Columbo (Safari users may have to click the bookmark twice), then search away.

    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>
      Columbo was developed for analysts at <a href="http://collectiveintellect.com">Collective Intellect</a> who needed 
      to search for sets of words on lots of webpages. They were using the find tool built into the browser to search for one word at time.
      That was time consuming and ineffective.  Now they are able to type in several terms to Columbo and quickly find relevant content. 
    </p>
    
    <h1>Who?</h1>
    <p>
      Columbo's internals were hacked together by <a href="http://ubermajestix.com" title="awesomeness is awesome">Tyler Montgomery</a>. 
      Columbo's awesome looking interface was designed by <a href="http://jeffreylarrimore.com" title="be more regalmore!">Jeffrey Larrimore</a>.
